Installations for setting up development environment:

easy-install sublime
Download Xcode9.4.1 (needed to install homebrew)
Download Command Line Tools (needed to install homebrew)

I installed python 3.5.5 with homebrew and pyenv in:
/usr/local/var/pyenv/versions/3.5.5
/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.0


Alternative to Homebrew:
Just download python version from python webpage
and install it...

Then pip didn't work, so I add the following to my pip config file inside my virtual env
vi $VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf

Also doesn't work, so:
brew install openssl
brew unlink openssl && brew link openssl --force

also doesnt work, so:
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"

also doesnt work, so:

SO, install python again, but this thime changing somethin in the setup file:
I got around this by uncommenting lines 209-212 in Python-3.6.0/Modules/Setup

SSL=/usr/local/ssl
_ssl _ssl.c \
        -DUSE_SSL -I$(SSL)/include -I$(SSL)/include/openssl \
        -L$(SSL)/lib -lssl -lcrypto

then again navigate to python folder and:
./configure
make
make install


Install Homebrew by:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

add to ~/.profile:
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

Now install finally python:
brew install python

Rest: Follow the instructions from Gitlab with virtualenv etc.
Actually, for the virtualenv, make sure to use usr/local/bin instead of usr/bin to point to python3.5, so
virtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3.5 venv

Don't forget to also install gcloud as described in install.md
gcloud config list
run: gcloud auth application-default login



Jupyter Notebook:
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install jupyter


Java Stuff:
Download JDK from Java website
find out your java home:
echo $JAVA_HOME

Replace JAVA_HOME WITH EXISTING PATH and Use as keystore password: changeit
keytool --importcert --keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts --file lastmile-root.pem --alias lastmile-root

Do this for the 4 files listed in the online guide
